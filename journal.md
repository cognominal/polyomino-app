I did a first attempt at polyominos that I will archive. I was overwhelmed by the many balls (new to me) I had
to juggle with. My web skills were superficial and
15-20 years old. [Front end Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) and [fireship](https://fireship.io/) are
helping though.

The result was underwhelming even if I learned a lot. 

Overwhelmed person ==> underwhelming results :)

I am again at it juggling with over more balls starting from a chat with
[ChatGPT 4o](https://chatgpt.com/share/66e6d670-3170-8001-a5df-127b7e2e4500).
I hope they will make work this shareable link which is currently broken.


 app using [ChatGPT 4o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/)
and [shadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/).



Note : so far, within and outside vscode I am using
phind.com. I have been unable to use my openai credentials
in chatGPT extensions.

I am trying to follow the instruction of 4o.
